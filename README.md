# <Week 1 Challenge- HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor>

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to refractor the provdided code to meet accessibility standards and the web page is functional. This was accomplished by fixing the code for the nav links to work, providing alt description to images, improving the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, and organizing the code with the appropriate semantic HTML elements (can be viewed via source code).

This assignment was to practice real-life situations of what a developer would work on for clients and help understanding best practices when refactoring code (leave the code a little clean than when you found it).
